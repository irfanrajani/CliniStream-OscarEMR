## Building from Source
... yeah its possible
However you miss out on thousands of lines of script in the Deb package that configures standard OSCAR settings, adds extras, and maintains the schema for you.
But we are open source, so if you want, and especially if you known what you want, you can build the OSCAR war with Maven
"mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -Dpmd.skip=true package"
