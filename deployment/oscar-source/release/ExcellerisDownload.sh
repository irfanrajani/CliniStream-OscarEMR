# ExcellerisDownload.sh
# a script file for OSCAR that copies lab reports from Excelleris
# that have been date stamped for easy sorting
# to the HL7 folder from where they can be uploaded by Mule
# as per Excelleris EMR Interface Guide v. 1.3.3 Oct 2023

# Modified from a script by Tom Le and Muki
# Adapted for OSCAR 19 by Peter Hutten-Czapski Aug 2024
# Version 1.0.5 Oct 12, 2024

INSTRUCTIONS
* Place this script into a DIRECTORY in your server and make it executable

* Copy the Excelleris PFX file for Clinic to a subdirectory with structure similar to
<SCRIPT DIR>/excelleris_download/cert/QA Peter Hutten Czapski MPC.pfx

* Create a config_inc.txt file in the top <SCRIPT DIR> with the following contents:

CONTEXT="<Clinic Name>"
USERNAME="<Clinic Excelleris User ID>"
PASSWORD="<Clinic Excelleris Password>"
PFX="<Excelleris supplied PFX file>"
CERT_PASS="<Clinic Excelleris certificate passphrase>"
HL7URLPATH="<test or production URI for the given province eg https://api.on.excelleris.com/hl7pull.aspx>"
MULE_HOME="<path to mule-1.3.3 directory that you installed>"
MULE_HL7PATH="<path to downloaded lifelabs reports from your Mule configuration>"
MULE_ERRORS="<path you configured/will configure for reports that fail to upload>"
MULE_DONE="<path you configured/will configure for uploaded files>"
MULE_LOG="<path to Mule log file>"
LOG_FILE="<path to Downloading script log file>"
EMAIL="<address@which2sendERRORS>"
SLEEP=<no quotes just the number of seconds it takes for the OSCAR server to upload the results>

* NOTES
CONTEXT is not used by the script but is included to reduce risks of mixing up credentials
The passed HL7URLPATH for ONTARIO for testing is
https://api.ontest.excelleris.com/hl7pull.aspx
for production is
https://api.on.excelleris.com/hl7pull.aspx
for BC simply replace on with bc
https://api.bc.excelleris.com/hl7pull.aspx

* Setup a crontab to run the script

* Setup automated uploading for the received files eg hl7_file_management
https://bitbucket.org/oscaremr/hl7_file_management/src/master/
